The Bash scripts for executing the code are bash_1.sh, bash_2.sh, bash_3.sh

For data for Plotting the graphs for section 6.2 we should execute the bash scripts:

Experiment-1
bash bash_1.sh seq
bash bash_1.sh sam
bash bash_1.sh dam

in each case the Output is printed to the output.txt file after the execution of bash is done.
After you have data for this copy this data and execute in the 1.py in the Analysis folder by replacing the above obtained values with the existing values.
Then do:
	python3 1.py # For graph generation

Experiment-2
bash bash_2.sh seq
bash bash_2.sh sam
bash bash_2.sh dam

in each case the Output is printed to the output.txt file after the execution of bash is done.
After you have data for this copy this data and execute in the 2.py in the Analysis folder by replacing the above obtained values with the existing values.
Then do:
	python3 2.py # For graph generation

Experiment-3
bash bash_3.sh seq
bash bash_3.sh sam
bash bash_3.sh dam

in each case the Output is printed to the output.txt file after the execution of bash is done.
After you have data for this copy this data and execute in the 3.py in the Analysis folder by replacing the above obtained values with the existing values.
Then do:
	python3 3.py # For graph generation

Experiment-4
For this code We have not written the scripts required. As it was mentioned in the problem statement that codes need not be required to submit, so we have actually put our effort in analysing the resultant graphs.

For graphs in the section 6.1 the graphs follows the similar code as that of the above we don't have the codes for that because we have commented out that code in the corresponding 3 CPP files. But you can clearly see the similarity in graphs with the section 6.2 graphs.
