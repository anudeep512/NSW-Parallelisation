# Parallelising NSW Search Algorithm

This is mini research project which is done in group of two which is done under guidance of [Dr.Sathya Peri](https://people.iith.ac.in/sathya_p/). In this research project we have come up with a parallel version for search algorithm in NSW graphs.

## About the File structure

We have implemented the parallel version of the search algorithm in two ways:

- Static allocation of Data to threads (SAM)
- Dynamic allocation of Data to threads (DAM)

The file **seq.cpp** is the sequential code for building and querying of the NSW graphs.

The file **dam.cpp** is the DAM code for building and querying of the NSW graphs.

The file **sam.cpp** is the SAM code for building and querying of the NSW graphs.

The folder **Dataset** contains the data required for testing the algorithm.

The file **ReadMe.txt** contains the instructions for execution of codes.

The files **Report.pdf** and **Presentation.pdf** and **Poster.pdf** contains the full detials of the project. The results of the work, the algorithm explanation and many more points regarding the Project can be found in these files.
